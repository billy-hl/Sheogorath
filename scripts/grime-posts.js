/**
 * Posts the rules and the about-the-game note in Grime and Punishment.
 *
 * Both are channels Sheogorath reads before answering (`channels.rules` and
 * `channels.serverInfo`), so what is written here is what he tells people about
 * the server and the game. Keep it true, and keep anything under the NDA out:
 * these channels are public.
 *
 * Edits its own last post in each channel rather than adding another, so a
 * re-run fixes a typo instead of stacking copies. REST only, no gateway login.
 *
 *   node scripts/grime-posts.js            # print what would be posted
