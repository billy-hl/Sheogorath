/**
 * The part of him that thinks, with nothing in it that knows what Discord is.
 *
 * Everything here used to live inside askChatGPT() in index.js, wrapped around
 * a discord.js Message — it read `.author.username`, called `.channel.send()`,
 * and handed a Guild to the action executors. None of that is thinking; it is
 * the shape of one particular room he happens to speak in. Twitch, Kick and
 * YouTube chat are the same conversation through a different window, and a
 * second copy of this file per window is how a persona ends up behaving like
 * three different characters.
 *
 * So the split is: this module owns the conversation — cooldowns, history,
 * notes, memories, prompt assembly, the repetition retry, the actions he asks
 * for and the record kept afterwards. A *surface* owns everything that is true
 * only of where he is standing: what the room's text looks like once it is
 * cleaned up, what context can be gathered there, which persona length fits,
 * what an action even means on that platform, and how a reply gets sent.
 *
 * A surface is a plain object with these members. Only `persona` is required.
 *
 *   persona()                  -> { systemBase, systemSuffix?, guildId?,
 *                                   historyDepth?, maxTokens? }
 *   context({ turn })          -> { blocks?: {chat, knowledge, deletions,
 *                                   reply, attachments, ping},
 *                                   deepRecall?: boolean,
 *                                   images?: [{caption, mime, data}],
 *                                   lookup?: boolean }
 *   executeActions(acts, ctx)  -> Array<result>   (omitted: he is read-only)
 *   resultNotes(results)       -> Array<string>   (what to append about them)
 *   remember                   -> boolean         (mine this turn for facts?)
 *
 * A `turn` is the message itself, already stripped of whatever markup its
 * platform writes names in:
 *
 *   { spaceId, roomId, userId, username, text }
 *
 * `spaceId` is the server, channel or stream he is being spoken to in — a
 * Discord guild id today, `twitch:allisteras` later. It is the key that notes,
 * memories and conversation history hang off, so two surfaces sharing a
 * spaceId deliberately share a mind, and two that do not, do not.
