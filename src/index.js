 * Whether a #help message is one person answering another, rather than asking.

 * say "verify your files" got answered too, which is noise at best and talking
 * over somebody at worst. The channel works better when the people helping are
 * left alone to help.
 *
 * WHY THESE TWO SIGNALS AND NOT THE MODEL
 * Both are structural facts about the message rather than readings of its text.
 * Asking the model "is this person helping?" would be a judgement call made on
 * input written by the person being judged, it would cost a call on every line
 * in the channel, and it would be wrong often enough to be worse than silence.
 * A Discord reply and an @ are things somebody DID, not things they claimed.
 *
 * A REPLY TO SHEOGORATH IS STILL A QUESTION FOR HIM. Replying to his own
 * message is how a follow-up looks, so that case falls through and is answered.
 * An unresolvable reference is treated as a reply to a person: staying quiet
 * when we cannot tell is the recoverable mistake, since the asker can still say
 * his name, while answering over a helper cannot be taken back.
