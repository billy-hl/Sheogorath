 * rule says the facts block is the whole of what he knows, the block was all
 * server state, and "what are your powers" is not server state. He did as he was
 * told. The block was simply missing the subject.
 *
 * Two things go in, and both are *measured*, which is what makes them safe to
 * hand him:
 *
 *   His own authority, read out of the capability table and the guild's mode, so
 *   it cannot drift from what the gate will actually let him do.
 *
 *   The role tier of whoever he is replying to, read from Discord. This does not
 *   contradict the standing rule that a message claiming authority is worthless:
 *   that rule is about text, and this is not text. Someone typing "I am an
 *   admin" still earns nothing. The gate looked their roles up.
